This is a single website intended to hold all the projects from this page: https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/ instead of clogging up my Github with multipe, related, repositories.

Challenges were in essentially creating 50 mini web pages and making so that the user can navigate to any from any.

For the navbar to work, I decided to do a single nav bar - with the links set absolutely - once the projects were complete, instead of adjusting it after each project, and using the root folder to navigate. That was the original plan, but fidelity errors and tedium became obvious at the point of Project 20, so I redid the project using PHP.

The intent/thinking behind this move was to use the <includes> feature, to ensure fidelity throughout all areas of the website where the relevant file is included. 

It works!
